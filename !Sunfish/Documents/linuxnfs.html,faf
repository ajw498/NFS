These notes were kindly provided by Allan Curtis. They relate to his
experience with Mandrake 10, but should be very similar on most distributions that accept rpms.
<p>
Firstly, if not already installed you will have to install the NFS server
which is somewhat obscurely called nfs-utils and should be included with your
distribution.  With Mandrake, use the package manager to add this
application.
<p>
Normally, the portmap application will be already installed.  If it isn't you
will need to install this from your distribution CDs.
<p>
You will now need to edit the /etc/exports file as root to define the
directories as well as the daughter directories that you will export.  You
can also define which computers can see these directories and the access
permissions that you allow.  An example will explain the syntax.
<p>
<code>/home/allan 195.150.1.4(rw) 195.150.1.5(ro)</code>
<p>
In this case I have allowed two computers with IP addresses 195.150.1.4 and
195.150.1.5 access to /home/allan and all it's daughter directories and
files.  I have allowed 195.150.1.4 full read/write access while the other
computer only has read only access. (NB: there should be no gap between the
final digit of the ip address and the opening bracket of the access
permission).  If you wish, you can also edit the /etc/hosts file to give
names to the above computers and hence use their names rather than IP
addresses.  Just follow the syntax of the existing entries in the /etc/hosts
file.
<p>
If you want to, or are allowed to login to the server without a password,
then you only need to find out your user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) to
finish all that you need to do under Linux.  Under Mandrake, open the User
Manager application (you will need to login as root) to discover the UID and
GID.  If you require a login with a password and are using Suse then all is
easy as the required pcnfsd application is nicely packaged for you.  For the
rest of us, it is not so easy.  The pcnfsd application is rather old and
needs to be patched for a modern distribution.  You will need to install the
following rpms in this order:
<p>
<ul>
<li>ld.so-1.9.5-11.LS1.i386.rpm which I found <a href="http://www.kcs-inc.co.jp/laser5/rpm2html/local/i386/ld.so-1.9.5-11.LS1.i386.html">here</a>.
<li>libc-5.4.44-1glibc.i386.rpm
<li>pcnfsd-2.0lsh-6shadow.i386.rpm
</ul>

both of these applications can be located from www.rpmfind.net.
<p>
Hopefully, that will have a working NFS system on your Linux box.  Further
information can be found on <a href="http://nfs.sourceforge.net">http://nfs.sourceforge.net</a>.
